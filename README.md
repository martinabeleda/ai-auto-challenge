## Development

See the [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for installing poetry.

To set up a local dev environment, create a `virtualenv` using poetry:

```bash
poetry shell
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

To run a local development instance with `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
